  every keyboard shortcut on dima's mac is now on one page he can open and annotate, built from a scan that reads five apps' own settings files directly, and the shortcut clash that had been breaking his dictation is gone. six overlapping mac-cleaning apps became one, chosen on measured evidence rather than reputation, and two of the apps he was told to delete turned out to be worth keeping.
  live / next: the hotkey map is live and reseeds itself from a single command; the rebind session that uses it waits for research on which keys are natural to reach. before that, the github ci and pull request work resumes from where it was parked.
  worth a line: the mystery process eating over a gigabyte of memory, which looked like apple's new ai, turned out to be claude's own sandbox.

# 🗞️ cclio's gazette · the zoo cull day — one page for every hotkey, six cleaners become one, and two verdicts get reversed

## shipped

- **the hotkey map** — [DOT-237](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/DOT-237) prep done, and the ticket now carries it as a «prep» section above dima's own notes. `pnpm hotkeys:scan` reads wispr flow's `config.json`, magnet's and bartender's plists, cursor's `keybindings.json` and `symbolichotkeys` into one json (81 bindings, modifier order canonical); raycast and cleanshot are sealed, so their rows are typed by hand in `script/lib/hotkeys-manual.ts` from dima's screenshots. the page is an air75 drawn in css grid with a tab per modifier layer, free keys listed per layer, and a note per chord kept in the artifact db — [hotkey map](https://claude.ai/code/artifact/3779fd12-ca37-403d-8083-e0d9c1f130e2), source at `docs/hotkeys/map.html`. seed-only by construction: it has no door into any app.
- **the opt+2 clash, closed** — wispr flow's prompt-engineer transform sat on raycast's ukrainian-layout key and the card's ✕ would not unbind it; the answer is the transforms «opt in» toggle, which drops the whole transform shortcut layer. dima opted out, and the next scan confirmed the binding gone.
- **the cleaner zoo, six to one** — mole is the pick ([repo](https://github.com/tw93/mole), 67k stars, released the same day), free cli via brew plus the $19 native gui dima bought and likes. appcleaner (last release 2023-07-04) removed by the gui; pearcleaner removed after its maintainer's own README turned out to say he lost *a mac to build on*, not the source — dima's recollection was close and wrong on the detail. keka survives a reversed verdict, see below. the brewfile now carries `mole`, `mole-app` and `keka`, and `notion-cli` moved from a formula line to the cask it always was, which is why `brew bundle check` had been failing.
- **two reversals, both on evidence** — keka was recommended for deletion and stays: its bundle ships `keka7zz`, `kekaunar` and `kekaunrar`, so it *is* the archive clis, not a duplicate of them; root `CLAUDE.md` gained one tooling line so the fleet stops re-suggesting `unar`. and `SiriAUSP`, flagged as apple intelligence and 564 MB of it, is `com.apple.texttospeech.SiriAUSP` — dima's read-aloud engine, the siri nora voice on option+escape. turning apple intelligence off frees ~50 MB, not the 2 GB claimed, and read-aloud is untouched by it. a reminder carries that for the next macos release.
- **the halt sweeps lingering tickets** — cclio 0.3.41: phase 0 queries In Progress and In Review in one call and prints «closable, because» or «stays, because» per hit. [BYT-83](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/BYT-83) had sat In Review two days past its merge and closed with a closing word; [BYT-85](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/BYT-85) went back to Todo because its real want is unbuilt; [BYT-25](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/BYT-25) likewise. dima's ask and his reason: no linear automation, because a merge is not a done while coders are still working the ticket.
- **smaller**: [DOT-247](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/DOT-247) — a chord-only `CGEvent` tap daemon plus a `top` reader, created after research found nothing that counts chords per app; it carries dima's «combine, not scatter» note and points at `cmdstats`, the shell-command counter a coder left in `cmdlog.zsh`. `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL=opus` in settings, because a fork always runs the parent model and two fable forks spent ~365k tokens on web reading. two linear quicklinks imported into raycast by deeplink, one jumping to an issue id and one searching both teams.

## tricks gained

- raycast's and cleanshot's stores are encrypted; wispr flow, magnet, bartender, cursor and `symbolichotkeys` all read straight from disk, and any running app's menu shortcuts come out of the accessibility api
- macos exposes no api to enumerate the global hotkeys other apps registered — a leftover chord is resolved by pressing it, not by querying
- raycast has no unattended config write path: the `ray` cli is extension-dev only, and the real door is `raycast://…/import-quicklinks?context=<urlencoded json>`, which prefills everything and still needs one human Enter. aliases and hotkeys have no programmatic path at all
- a brew cask is best removed by `brew uninstall --zap --cask` — mole agrees so strongly that it detects the cask and hands it back to brew; the zap stanza found `Group Containers`, `Saved Application State` and a `bin/` symlink that mole's scan missed
- keka's bundled binaries are reachable as `Keka --cli <bin>`; macos ships no `unrar` and no 7z at all
- macos «inactive» memory is cache that is handed over on demand — 15.6 GB of it read as 81% used while swap sat at 61 MB
- `sudo lsof` on an unexplained vm named it in one line: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/vm_bundles/`, holding open handles on the dotfiles tree
- `brew install --cask --adopt` needs a tty when the bundle is root-owned, and an agent shell has none

## state

- dotfiles `4f858e5`, 6 commits unpushed by dima's standing «not urgent»; bytes untouched today; no coders, no worktrees
- dima's tools · next overhaul · 19/25 — DOT-247 joined it, DOT-237 keeps its place in the order
- two handoffs pending on purpose: halt16 parks the github ci and pull request plan, today's parks the hotkeys and cleaners thread. a pickup names its slug, never bare
- next: the rebind session on DOT-237 needs the natural-key research first; [DOT-248](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/DOT-248) (kb layout alternatives) arrived from dima and is unread
