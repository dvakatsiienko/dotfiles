  the git overhaul is done in one sitting: dima's git config is modern and commented line by line, diffs are pretty, and a set of short recipes (what shipped today, branches by age, who wrote what) live in git itself. the branch cleanup tool got smart about squash merges and asks before anything risky. the fleet picked its headless browser, agent-browser, after two coders measured it against playwright and the desktop pane; playwright left the fleet. trophy-sys stats has all twelve charts on production, with a coder in the desktop app driving the polish.
  live / next: dima judges the twelve charts tomorrow and prunes; the walkthrough evenings (shell internals, dynamic workflows) come next; then the rest of the overhaul milestone in the order he set.
  worth a line: the agents now propose and wait on anything that touches dima's own tools, with a standing «waiting on your word» block at the end of every reply.

# 🗞️ cclio's gazette · the git and browser day — the overhaul lands, playwright leaves, the agents learn to wait

## shipped

- **git overhaul, one sitting, closed** — [DOT-159](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/DOT-159) + [DOT-38](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/DOT-38): every gitconfig line with its reason, delta as pager (agent-safe off-tty), nvim editor, rerere/histogram/zdiff3/fetch.prune/autosquash/updateRefs/branch.sort. recipes under one `[pretty] fleet` look: `lg ship standup br vs who last churn fixup pick pickfrom`. `gprune` rebuilt: ages, squash-merge detection via commit-tree + cherry, held-with-reason, `-D` per branch, `--stale`, `-h`, tab completion. 8 zsh aliases retired by dima's line-by-line review; his verdict on the rest: «gs-class are easier to remember, worth to keep both». research: opus coder, zero agent-side tools worth adding — plain git holds. lefthook ext unified to `.yaml`; inner-marker got the push hook; auto-assign verified dead on all three repos.
- **the headless browser settled** — a researcher picked `agent-browser` 0.36.0 (rust daemon, 30 ms attach vs playwright's 820 ms `connectOverCDP`, `--json` verbs, system chrome, zero download); the Code-tab coder re-measured with the same fan-out: 46/46 tie on points, agent-browser wins on wants. dima: «delete pw everywhere, we use only agent-browser» — 509 MB cache trashed, `x:browser-headless` shipped (x 0.11.18) with four measured hazards (swallowed flags report ✓, click does not auto-wait, shared eval scope, two token-bomb verbs).
- **trophy-sys /stats complete on prod** — [BYT-65](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/BYT-65): all 12 charts + kpi strip in visx, sort controls, heatmap→timeline link, mobile overflow fixed (390px was broken, three causes), lazy-loaded route (bundle 582 → 332 kB), colour in one file, tooltips escape panels. two coders in a row held the prod merge on a relayed word — correct; cclio merged on dima's. In Progress for his prune verdicts tomorrow.
- **the agents learn to wait** — after an alias prune ran on one word while dima was reading: every reply ends with «⏳ waiting on your word», sweeps over his tools are propose-only, a coder's reply is never an advancement sign. new fleet words: **`granular`** (label + chat word: every change needs his weighted approve) and **`mil`**. execution order rides linear's native `sortOrder`; every new mil opens with a sorting phase. the next-overhaul tail ordered by him.
- **folds** — the bureau → [DOT-14](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/DOT-14) as a cli naming option · advise-project-approach → [BYT-59](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/BYT-59) plan-time · g2i skipped, neuroarxiv a test candidate ([DOT-187](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/DOT-187)) · shell-internals walkthrough secured in [DOT-17](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/DOT-17) with the ryan baker playlist as the agent's orientation · gazette got its definition (meaningful work, ticketed or not) · cw gazette lane confirmed by dima, doc folded into the procedure · homebrew hints silenced.

## tricks gained

- squash-merged detection: `git commit-tree <branch>^{tree} -p $(git merge-base main <branch>)` then `git cherry main <tmp>` — «-» means main holds the patch · zsh collapses an empty tab-separated field, use `%1f` · a `cat <<EOF` inside a python heredoc ends the outer heredoc — pick a different outer delimiter · vitest counts a worktree's test copies (166 = 2 × 83) · the desktop Browser pane exists only in Code-tab-born sessions, and a hidden pane never lays the page out · an idle coder's «push or keep going?» is addressed to dima, not the coordinator.

## state

- dotfiles + bytes + inner-marker clean on origin · next overhaul 14/22 · tomorrow: BYT-65 verdicts in parallel with the walkthrough hoist, then the mil tail in dima's order · after the halt: the initiative question (mils utilization).
