  Dima's trophy dashboard got its finishing pass and a new trophy log page, both live on prod, and the agent fleet lost its desktop coordinator for good. A dynamic workflow read all 82 open tickets in 35 seconds and every question that had been waiting on Dima in a ticket body got answered.
  live / next: next session opens with Dima designing trophy-sys's new look in the desktop Design tab, then the tokens go into code.
  worth a line: the same day, one command of Dima's git status grew a face and Claude's own permissions file lost 110 lines that did nothing.

# 🗞️ cclio's gazette · the walkthrough day — three tours, one workflow, and dispatch leaves

## shipped

- **trophy-sys pass 3 + 4, live on prod** — [BYT-65](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/BYT-65) closed after three days: readability floor (105 → 46 text nodes below 12px, then every axis tick to 11px), rarity tie marker, playtime join 100 → 103/109, `handler.js` out of git via Build Output API v3 (one ~12-min outage on the way, owned in `deploy-history.md`). [BYT-67](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/BYT-67) same evening: `/log` replaces `/news` (every trophy, icon + description, sittings drawn as a css tree, games link to the library), `/stats` as one grid (panels stretch to rows, zero panel scrollers, «skill curve» → «rarity drift», closest-to-done + abandoned → «unfinished» with a dormant marker, dima's order), 12 review findings fixed. the single-hue rarity ramp tried, measured, reverted on his eyes. 16 bytes commits by one Code-tab coder who crossed 900k context and stayed precise.
- **three walkthroughs** — the stamp-ref (`conventions/package-scripts-order.md` + the new `guide-ui-ux` skill, born from a 20-rule sourced research); permissions ([DOT-209](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/DOT-209), rest open): 37-line `allow` list and the 71-line `autoMode` block deleted as inert under bypass, seven denies kept by verdict; dynamic workflows ([DOT-222](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/DOT-222) closed): `board-sweep.js` saved under `~/.claude/workflows`, 82 open tickets judged by 11 sonnet agents in 35 s, 1.27M tokens, 1 false positive in 14 non-fine rows.
- **the 10 «needs-dima» asks the sweep found — all answered** in a step-by-step: DOT-14 scheduled behind sline, DOT-177 flipped to `needs agent`, DOT-148 = full bun migration or none, DOT-147 placed, [DOT-115](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/DOT-115) closed and it grew into **dispatch retiring** ([DOT-236](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/DOT-236), done the same evening: two memory files, the boot command, the glossary line, the pm token, five ticket clauses), DOT-24 decided, BYT-55 on a 10-04 vet, BYT-44 grill scheduled, BYT-40 portfolio-first, BYT-60 three name ideas parked.
- **dima's tools** — `git sup` (branch pill, drift, stash, grouped tree) with `sup` re-pointed; starship chevrons now conditional (the empty-block prompt outside repos is gone); the roadmap initiative lost its text copy of the order — the graph (dates, statuses, edges) is the only order; project **monorepo** born for bytes-the-repo sweeps ([BYT-56](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/BYT-56) + BYT-64 in, BYT-52 → [DOT-43](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/DOT-43) under the cli epic).
- **research folded** — desktop Design tab vs the cc `design` skill: not parity; the tab builds the system, the skill is a mockup canvas that reads tokens. verdict on DOT-209 and BYT-25; next session opens with dima in the tab. vibecoding companions ([DOT-231](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/DOT-231) closed): `usage` and Claude Usage Tracker installed, judged, uninstalled — `usage` had rewritten `~/.claude/settings.json` with eight dead http hooks; the mirror gate caught it. tui crash filed upstream (aqua5230/usage#125).

## tricks gained

- a Code-tab session has the Browser pane but `document.hidden` stays true for scripts, so charts never measure there — agent-browser for every layout check; the `browser-headless` trigger no longer excludes Code-tab sessions · Code-tab peers talk through `mcp__ccd_session_mgmt__send_message`, both sides, ids in the brief; transcript reads for the picture · a tapped cask is always written with its full path — bare `usage` resolved to core's `usage-app` and clobbered the right app on a case-insensitive disk · `pnpm plugin-release` false-negatives when the cache is behind (freebie queued) · vercel picks functions at clone time, not build time — a relay must open the repo's own docs first · a reading agent's cost is bodies × size.

## state

- dotfiles + bytes clean on origin · next overhaul 16/22 · roadmap step 3 · next session: dima's Design tab session first, then BYT-66 after the design, then the mil tail (DOT-209 rest, DOT-228 its own session) · coder kept alive, compacted by dima · vets: `Workflow` allow line, proto-lab 10-04, brew picks 09-15, initiative 09-17.
