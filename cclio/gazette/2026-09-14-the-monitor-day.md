  dima's mac now counts which keyboard shortcuts and apps he actually uses, a small daemon built and live the same morning, with a one-word command that prints the top chords and app switches. raycast got its first real settings pass, the coder plugins that fired in the wrong sessions were removed, and apple shortcuts got an honest verdict after three research rounds: keep only the phone's action button, nothing on the mac.
  live / next: the usage daemon accumulates for two weeks before the hotkey rebind session; the raycast walkthrough resumes at the applications entry; the birman keyboard layout moves under brew and the built-in U.S. source hack is tried at a quiet moment.
  worth a line: the shortcut menu dima wanted on his phone was built by an agent and installed with one click, and then scrapped an hour later because one of the two dictation apps does not insert its text on toggle.

# 🗞️ cclio's gazette · the monitor day — a daemon counts the chords, raycast gets its pass, apple shortcuts gets a verdict

## shipped

- **the hotkey monitor** — [DOT-247](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/DOT-247) done in three coder jobs on one warm session: `x-hotkey-stats-monitor`, a swift session tap under launchd that logs modifier chords, bare `ctrl` (wispr push-to-talk) and every app switch and launch to jsonl, plus the reader `pnpm hotkey-monitor:top` / alias `hk` with app names, `--days`, `--app`, `--ignore` and a «bound but never pressed» join against the map scan (66 of 81 on day one). measured on the way: raycast swallows the hyper key at the hid layer and re-posts a synthetic chord, so the tap sits on the session, never hid; `opt+esc` read-aloud dominates every ranking. `cmdlog` deleted, one tracker instead of two. name aligned on every layer after dima's ask — dir, binary, launchd label, codesign id, data dir — and root `CLAUDE.md` now carries the rule: one name on every layer, `grep` of the old name empty is the done criterion.
- **raycast, phases 1–3 of the plan** — [DOT-237](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/DOT-237) In Progress with an eight-phase e2e plan in its body: raycast adopted under brew (`--adopt`, settings untouched), the dead-weight inventory (zero AI-visible leftovers on disk, settings are SQLCipher-encrypted so every toggle is confirmed by eye), the walkthrough through general, launcher, keyboard, cloud sync, advanced, AI, apple shortcuts. decisions: fallbacks trimmed to seven, secure input on, cloud sync data deleted then off, weekly encrypted export into `import/raycast/backups/` with the three script commands moved to `import/raycast/script-commands/`, window management kept for a magnet trial, AI killed, focus and dictation on eval. the «app comes to me» want is a per-app All Desktops setting, not a raycast option — raycast's space setting covers its own windows only.
- **birman stays** — [DOT-248](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/DOT-248) closed: the only universal alternative (dovhan's) gates ✓ and arrows behind opt+shift and last shipped in 2022. the un-removable U.S. input source has one door, a plist hack, parked with the brew move for a quiet moment.
- **apple shortcuts, verdict keep-minimal** — three agents: power users call it a real tool with a policy ceiling and yearly reliability bugs; it wins only where raycast has no body, the phone's action button and iOS triggers. agent authoring proven with cherri → `shortcuts sign` → one click, then cherri removed because the mac gets zero authoring. the iOS two-tap read-aloud is an accessibility switch (Speech Controller → Speak on Touch), not a shortcut; the action button never receives a selection.
- **plugins culled** — superwhisper's claude plugin (unmaintained since may, panel clips on a 1080p-scaled screen, data point posted on its [issue #16](https://github.com/superultrainc/superwhisper-claude-code/issues/16)), the english buddy (dima dictates now) with its hook and rule section, impeccable disabled globally (its Stop hook ran a 9-minute «design deep pass» because a probe `.ts` counts as UI; cclio enables it around design coders only). a biome format-on-edit hook replaced the noise: `PostToolUse` on `Edit|Write`, walks up to the repo's own biome, silent.
- **smaller**: bytes [#86](https://github.com/dvakatsiienko/bytes/pull/86) — `git rev-parse --verify` accepts any well-formed sha, so renovate's rebased branches died with exit 128 on the push run; `^{commit}` fixed it, #85 automerges. [DOT-249](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/DOT-249) born and folded the same day into [DOT-41](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/DOT-41)'s inventory (verdict absorb) and [DOT-14](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/DOT-14)'s candidate list. scroll restoration for trophy-sys is a line in [BYT-89](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/BYT-89). the ⏳ fence rule reverted: header outside, only the asks inside, because cw rendered the in-fence header as something to delete after every paste. `mo touchid enable` gives sudo touch id (macos writes `sudo_local` itself; mole only writes the line).

## tricks gained

- a `&` inside a Bash tool call is safe only when something after it keeps the shell alive — the wrapper exits and the child dies with exit 0 and an empty log (twice in one day)
- renaming a `.gitignore` path un-ignores whatever the old path still holds; `git add -A` staged a compiled binary
- a grep done-criterion is run once before it goes into a brief — «grep old-name empty» can never be empty when the new name contains the old
- macos TCC keys an ad-hoc binary by code identity: a rename or rebuild needs a fresh Input Monitoring grant and a daemon restart; a tap opened before the grant stays refused
- raycast 2.4's «window activation behavior» applies to raycast's own windows only; Dock → Options → All Desktops is the per-app answer
- an app-authored commit via `gh api` is authored as dima, so the owner-approval lane cannot green it — cclio's pr commits go through the app identity next time
- a desktop code block shows its copy button only at 4+ lines (four samples)
- a plugin's hooks stay loaded in running sessions after uninstall; only new sessions are clean

## state

- dotfiles: 14 commits unpushed by dima's standing word, today's edits uncommitted at the halt (commit plan in the halt board); bytes clean; no coders, one merged worktree to prune
- dima's tools · next overhaul · 21/25 — DOT-237 next, its walkthrough resumes at «Applications»
- reminders: birman → brew cask + U.S. plist hack at a quiet moment (dima, approved); impeccable disable watched at every design lane's end

## trail

- shipped: `x-hotkey-stats-monitor` daemon + `hk` reader (DOT-247 done), raycast phases 1–3 (adopted under brew, ai killed, cloud sync off), birman stays (DOT-248 closed), apple shortcuts verdict keep-minimal, superwhisper + english-buddy plugins culled, impeccable disabled globally, biome format-on-edit hook
- open: DOT-237 walkthrough resumes at «Applications»
- state: dotfiles 14 unpushed; bytes clean; no coders
