  the pull request reviewer changed hands today, then the second reviewer arrived: coderabbit's github app is gone and its cli stays local, claude code reviews any bytes pull request on «@claude review», and greptile is wired on bytes with its dashboard filtered and its cli plus skills installed. the dependency news layer got its second shape (cards with researched facts, brew in the same digest, one word runs the merges) and the first round landed: pnpm 12, postgres 18, checkout v7. x-com-chat got scoped into three tickets after a read of its 1.5-year-old code, and a one-page map of the whole agent setup was published for interviews.
  live / next: dima reads the three x-com-chat tickets cold, then an opus coder starts the routing-and-threads one, which doubles as the first of two pull requests that measure five reviewers against each other; graphite comes after the stack settles; tomorrow also the repo-identity ticket with dima at the keyboard.
  worth a line: he wrote «sounds like cheating from vercel's side» about the deploy quota with no evidence, and vercel's own doc confirmed it word for word — canceled builds started by the ignored build step count against the limit — and the fix had already landed two days earlier by accident.

# 🗞️ cclio's gazette · the reviewer day — coderabbit steps back to the cli, claude code takes the pull request

## shipped

- **the coderabbit github app is uninstalled** — free plan reviews nothing (summaries only, 10-star gate); only linear's webhooks remain on `bytes` + `dotfiles`. the cli moved from a hand-installed 0.3.1 to brew's cask **0.7.6** (Brewfile line, authed, `doctor` 9/9, token never expires). `.coderabbit.yaml` left bytes: the cli reads config only through `-c <files>`, and `CLAUDE.md` is the intended input. the `coderabbitai/skills` package judged dead weight on all three channels (thin wrappers, one skill needs the gh bot, flags stale) — not installed.
- **claude code reviews bytes pull requests** — `.github/workflows/claude.yml` (#63): `@claude review [focus]` runs the `code-review` plugin skill with inline comments, any other `@claude …` is interactive and may push to the branch; opus-5 `--effort high`, `--max-turns 30`, `allowed_bots: x-coder-bot[bot]`, subscription oauth token as a repo secret on both repos. no `pull_request` trigger: the coder pushes freely, the review starts on the comment. labels were considered and dropped as friction (option c locked in the plan).
- **proven on a bot pr** — #64 opened and commented by `x-coder-bot`: one inline finding on the planted off-by-one, 18 turns, 198 s of claude, 3m49s job wall time. two failures on the way, both fixed the same hour: the skill skipped the pr titled «throwaway» (it skips prs it judges trivial), and a vercel deploy comment cancelled the review through the shared concurrency group (#65 keys the group on the `@claude` predicate).
- **`x:coder-brief` 0.11.47** — «final» now reads: `coderabbit review --agent --base main -c CLAUDE.md` → fix → `code-review` → fix → push → `@claude review` → fix real / «declined: why» → at most one re-request → `gh pr edit --add-reviewer dvakatsiienko` → the word. a rate-limited tool is skipped and named, never waited on.
- `cclio/docs/gh-stack-adoption.md` tracked in git: step 0 ticked, step 1 all but the human-authored exit, step 2 wired.

## tricks gained

- a github app installation token can open prs and comment but not delete branches or call `/user` — the deletion is dima's `gh`
- `issue_comment` workflows run only from the default branch — a workflow pr cannot prove itself
- the action posts nothing until the run ends (`classify_inline_comments` buffers); a quiet pr mid-run is normal
- `coderabbit review` flags on 0.7.6: `--agent`, `--uncommitted`, `--committed`, `-c` — `--prompt-only` and `-t` are gone, docs and skills still name them
- never `coderabbit update` when brew owns the binary; `brew upgrade coderabbit` is the path

## state

- dotfiles `c702663`, bytes `4ca72eaf`, both clean on origin; no coder, no worktrees
- open: the human-authored review (dima's next pr) · greptile, step 3, fresh session · the cr `--show-prompts` probe on the first coder run · three inbox questions (renovate avatar, vercel quota research, graft eval) parked in the flowlog, inbox kept on dima's word
- inherited, unverified from here: the 16:00 interview, the vercel cap reset + prod redeploy, the first evergreen digest, DOT-228 run 2, the trophy-sys redesign morning

⸻ upd 20:45

## shipped (evening)

- **greptile is the second reviewer — step 3 of the stack plan wired** (dima's clicks + claude-in-chrome for the dashboard): app on `bytes` only, starter plan behind a 14-day pro trial; cli 3.5.2 via pnpm global (no brew formula), `x-com` org, `init` says enabled; `config` reads every `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md` and `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` in the repo as review rules on its own; dashboard: auto-review on commits off, description update off, «fix in claude» off, filters `source branch exclude renovate/*` (verified after reload); skills `greploop` + `greptile-cli` at user scope — greploop is a real evidence-based fix loop, kept; the marketplace «greptile» plugin is an http mcp, skipped. dima: «mcp is not good for us, cli is faster».
- **`x:coder-brief` 0.11.48 → 0.11.49** — the «final» chain is now coderabbit → matt's `code-review` (named explicitly, the ci action runs the built-in one) → greploop (cap 1) → push → `@claude review` + `@greptile review` in the same minute → add-reviewer → the word; the retro names which layer found what nobody else did. 0.11.49: pnpm 12 dropped the `-s` short flag and broke every `pnpm -s …:agent-token` snippet the same evening — `--silent` everywhere.
- **the measurement run, written as step 3b** of `cclio/docs/gh-stack-adoption.md`: the next two real coder prs run all three local tools on the same final commit before any fix, one sheet per tool (true, noise, time, unique, credits); decision 1 = which cli goes first in dima's fallback chain (coderabbit → greptile → matt's, by quota), decision 2 = greptile cli-only, ci-only or both. the brief switches after pr 2.
- **evergreen v2 — `cclio:evergreen` 0.3.32 → 0.3.34** after the taste interview: one card per major (brings, breaks, since last major, 🔬 deep with researched numbers and a source), ci-only majors are cards, minors fold, the brew lane rides the same digest with its own ➡️, «approve evergreen» runs merges + `brew upgrade` by cclio, conflicted prs get renovate's rebase box ticked, peer-range holds close with a comment. the «breaks» answer now reads every dependant's peer range first — the fork said «merge» on graphql 17 from a src grep while `@apollo/server` 5.5.1 declares `^16.11.0` (the coder had said so the day before). evening additions: `pnpm install` after the round, `pnpm dedupe` as its own deliberate commit, a weekly skills lane (`npx skills update`, `greptile skills update` — the convex set in `apps/x-com-chat` sat 5 months stale because nobody looks there), and a grep of our own cli flags on a pnpm major.
- **first evergreen round merged**: bytes #57 pnpm 12, #61 postgres 18, #66 checkout v7; dotfiles #35 pnpm 12 (`11bcd98`). bytes #56 graphql 17 closed on the apollo peer range; dotfiles #36 vitest 5 hit the lockfile conflict and waits on renovate's rebase. brew: 21 upgraded (pnpm 12.3.4, gh 2.100, iterm2 3.7 with its claude-code tab status). vercel cap reset confirmed, trophy-sys prod built 15:29 off `4ca72eaf`.
- **vercel quota, researched and closed** — dima's inbox: «why skipped builds count as a used deployment». vercel's monorepo doc: «canceled builds initiated using the Ignored Build Step count towards your deployment and concurrent build limits» — the six `turbo-ignore` lines removed on 09-07 were the burn. the built-in skip holds no build slot (daily-count effect unstated, inferred separate bucket); `deploymentEnabled: false` is the only certain zero; the 100/day is per **account** (9 projects on it), so separate repos would not change the cap. api check: `enableAffectedProjectsDeployments` true on all six. → `memory/dima-stories.md` «sounds like cheating from VC side».
- **x-com-chat scoped, three tickets in order** after a read-only pass over the app: [BYT-81](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/BYT-81) routes by friend name, threads per friend with a header selector (pill with the count, «＋ new thread» replaces a wipe button, in-row delete confirm, groq-generated titles, a ghosted intro bubble as the empty state), chat created on the first message, the theme one-liner (`dark` hard-coded into `<html className>`), an ai-sdk wiring review; [BYT-82](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/BYT-82) per-user threads after a five-question grill (anonymous cookie owner, claim on sign-in, github first, `/api/chat` guarded with a per-owner rate limit); [BYT-37](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/BYT-37) rewritten as the instant-shell pr on top. 81 and 82 are the two measurement prs; dima promoted both to Todo. found on the way: chats are global today (clerk is ui-only, no `ctx.auth` anywhere), `typescript.ignoreBuildErrors: true`, `initChat` and `getChatByFriend` duplicate each other.
- **tails**: the interview skill retired (cclio 0.3.31, `7daedad`); flawlog debt from 09-08 landed (worktree in-use check via live session cwds, the three bash-sandbox shapes in `fleet-hazards`, «measurement vs standing fact» as pre-write question 5); `.cursor/rules/` audited — five 2025-07 files, eight live lines move into `guide-typescript` / `guide-react`, the rest (a `React.FC` template, prettier, a 332-line ultracite dump greptile would read as review rules) is deleted on the next coder day with a root `AGENTS.md` pointer for cursor; graft skipped (the oss cli has no markdown nodes — its own video says «graft only maps code», the doc-linking fork is the author's paid community); renovate's avatar is mend's app identity, self-hosting for a logo discarded; [DOT-26](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/DOT-26) is dima + cclio on fable, tomorrow; spawn-init sound at 0.2.
- **the fleet map** — one page for a tech interview and for dima: roster, an svg flow of members ↔ git-tracked stores ↔ linear/github/vercel with dima as the gate row, four cards, six strengths against six weak parts. [x-com fleet](https://claude.ai/code/artifact/24c4be13-4f6f-4ff7-a4c6-78bc2810a73c), three redeploys until the diagram breathed and fit without a scrollbar.

## tricks gained (evening)

- a conflicted renovate pr is rebased by ticking the `<!-- rebase-check -->` box in its body — `gh pr edit --body-file` with `[ ]` → `[x]`; the hosted app documents no comment command
- pnpm 12 removed the `-s` short flag; `--silent` and `--reporter silent` remain
- greptile's cli `config` shows the org-level rules it reads (every `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.cursor/rules`) but «filters: none» even after a dashboard filter is saved — that field reads repo config files; the dashboard rule is the one that fires
- vercel's `skills` cli cannot update skills installed before skillPath tracking — one `npx skills add <source> -y` re-adds them, updates work after
- `greptile login` needs a live terminal for the oauth callback (a 20 s timeout kills it); `whoami` exits 0 even signed out — gate on its text
- the api field for vercel's built-in monorepo skip is `enableAffectedProjectsDeployments` on `/v9/projects/<id>`; the cli exposes nothing

## state (evening)

- dotfiles `dd6e4d7`, bytes `a7c0627e`, both clean on origin; no coder, no monitor, no worktrees
- open: dotfiles #36 vitest 5 on renovate's rebase; the greptile empty-open credit question (measured on BYT-81's pr; yes → a `review-ready` label rule, his word first); `npx skills add get-convex/agent-skills -y` in x-com-chat before the coder
- tomorrow: dima reads BYT-81 / 82 / 37 cold and steers → opus coder on BYT-81 → DOT-26 with dima on fable → DOT-228 notes bench in watch-mode (lanes one at a time on his «go»); graphite after the stack settles
