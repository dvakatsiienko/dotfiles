  raycast quicklinks got their grammar and seven live links, the caret language indicator is gone for good, cleanshot moved under raycast hotkeys, screenshots stitch on mac and ios, and the hotkey monitor now names what each chord does.
  live / next: aliases slice of the raycast overhaul, with a research round first; then snippets, script commands, and the hotkey phase with a pass over macos built-in shortcuts.
  worth a line: the language indicator fix was a name-versus-id bug that three research rounds called unfixable, and dima's «it worked before» was right.

# 🗞️ cclio's gazette · the quicklinks day — seven links with a grammar, the blue capsule dies, and every chord gets a name

## shipped

- **quicklinks sealed** — [DOT-237](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/DOT-237): a pre-research round found the only real corpus is raycast's own gallery and the rule «a quicklink earns its slot only with an argument or a path». seven live: `qy qg qd qh ql qs qt`, alias grammar `q` + letters, argument names `query` / `id` / `text`, linear-by-id as one arg so a hotkey passes the selection. the import deeplink lives under `raycast/quicklinks/…` — two failed tries went to manual paste before raycast's log named the wrong id in one line. raycast skips duplicates on import, so an update is delete + re-import + alias retyped; a double-click installer sits on the desktop. a second research round proposed six more (`claude://claude.ai/new?q={selection}`, obsidian inbox append, cursor prompt, linear new issue); dima took none — quicklinks are enough for one head.
- **cleanshot under raycast** — the store extension replaced the cleanshot quicklinks; `⇧⌘0–9` sealed (1 window · 2 ocr · 3 full · 4 area · 5 scroll · 6 aio · 7 history · 8 annotate · 9 record · 0 clipboard) with the reshuffle due from `hk` stats in two weeks. export location → `~/Desktop/screenshots`, desktop now icloud-synced; stitching = annotate drag-drop on mac (the only door, verified) and «Stitch Screenshots v4» shortcut on both platforms (combine 16 px → png → clipboard → ask-where-to-save, ✅/❌ notifications).
- **the blue caret capsule is off globally** — three research rounds said no global fix on macos 27 (`TSMLanguageIndicatorEnabled=0` made the birman ukelele layout vanish from TIS). the cause was never the os: with the pref off TIS derives custom-layout ids from the `.keylayout` name and ignores the bundle's plist, so select-by-id fails and select-by-**name** works. the three layout script commands now select by name and print a flag pill (`🇺🇦 🇷🇺 🇺🇸`). on the way: the bundle moved to `/Library/Keyboard Layouts` with a quarantine flag to strip, the U.S. layout removed by the plist trick, russian birman re-enabled through a 12-line swift.
- **`hk` names chords** — the hotkey monitor's reader prints `chord  action · app` from the manual map, with `since`-dated rows so a reshuffle never relabels the past; system chords labelled (paste, word moves, spaces from the scan), wispr's `paste_event` hook dropped as a binding. dima edits the map himself. `cmd+tab` 1835, `opt+esc` read-aloud 1550, `⇧⌘4` 334 over 30 days.
- **project manager, one list** — cursor's `projects.json` is the curated set (tags `1 core · 2 bytes · 3 config · 4 lab`, the digit is the group order because the raycast ext sorts tags alphabetically); `pnpm projects:sync` in bytes writes every app and package under `2 bytes`; the cursor recent-projects ext deleted, the Project Manager ext reads the same file. `ca` dies when the sync lands.
- **cw's game-notes thinking folded** — [BYT-102](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/BYT-102): one record per game in trophy-sys's redis, patchable by cli, «rethink first» with dima's frame verbatim (simplify cowork's access, never swap one unoptimal approach for another; obsidian as the alternative); `docs/research/trophy-sys-notes-store.md` with the lost-guide incident and the checklist; cw's f1–f8 into [BYT-86](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/BYT-86)'s candidates. batch d flushed the same evening: notion grants-by-nesting into `x:notes` (x 0.11.77), tracker data shapes into trophy-sys's guide, `.node-version` repinned to `24` in both repos (fnm had no 24.0.2, every shell prompted).
- **smaller**: [BYT-101](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/BYT-101) hosting split research (next stays on vercel, vite ejects — dima's seven vectors, blocked on whether the deploy cap still bites) · hide.me picked by research (only free tier with a real country picker), installed, NL exit ~2× latency vs 7× for US, `1.1.1.1` dead through it, dima dislikes the ui — a «pretty» round later · glow's file-list paging bug filed upstream ([#1037](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow/issues/1037): `paginator.Model{}` leaves the keymap empty; `f d b u` work, `h l ←→` do not) · linear mobile notifications: no cross-device dismissal exists, the lever is the account-level mobile push types.

## tricks gained

- raycast's log at `~/Library/Logs/com.raycast.macos/raycast-x-*.log` explains every «nothing happened» deeplink — third time it beat inference this week
- a raycast quicklink with two arguments cannot take the selection on a hotkey; single-arg only
- `TSMLanguageIndicatorEnabled=0` changes how TIS names custom layouts, not whether it loads them; select by display name
- macos removes an input source from the plist only through `defaults import` of the filtered `AppleEnabledInputSources` array (the U.S. layout has no minus button once it is the fallback)
- the raycast Project Manager ext sorts tag groups by raw string; a leading digit orders them
- `shortcuts sign` refuses a `.plist` input and takes the same file as `.wflow`; «Continue» on no input is the absence of the behaviour key; Run Shell Script is mac-only, Save File with ask-where is the ios path
- a `.node-version` pinned to a patch that fnm lacks prompts in every shell of that tree; pin the major
- `mas install` cannot fetch a free app the account never «got»; one app-store click, then the Brewfile line works
- github refuses labels from non-collaborators without an error worth the name (`failed to update 1 issue`)

## state

- dotfiles 5 commits unpushed (`7cb4ded`); bytes 1 unpushed on a tree 2 behind with untracked design docs + regenerated convex files — rebase at the next bytes session
- dima's tools · next overhaul · 21/25 — DOT-237 In Progress, phase 4 aliases slice next (pre-research first)
- no coders, no worktrees; halt16 CST still parked; x-com-chat prod red still parked
- reminders born: cleanshot reshuffle on/after 2026-10-01, node pin drift

## trail

- shipped: 7 raycast quicklinks (`q`+letters grammar), cleanshot ext under `⇧⌘0–9`, caret indicator off globally (select layout by name), `hk` chord labels, cursor projects.json as the one project list, BYT-102 game-notes model folded
- open: DOT-237 phase 4 aliases slice (pre-research first), then snippets, script commands, phase 5 hotkeys
- state: dotfiles 5 unpushed, bytes 1 unpushed on a tree 2 behind; no coders
