  the merge gate on bytes now reads the reviewer's own verdict instead of guessing from silence, and it was proven on real pull requests the same afternoon: findings go red, a clean round goes green, and a round nobody could judge goes red without spending the budget. dima's approval past the cap is the one human click left, and the lane that used to guess at it is deleted.
  live / next: dima called the gate overcomplicated and a probe agreed it cannot be replaced by github's own approvals, so the simplification waits for the greptile-on-ci decision on 2026-09-16; before that, wispr flow snippets, the ralph loop first run, and the vercel deploy zero.
  worth a line: the probe that was meant to replace the gate proved the replacement impossible and still found nine hundred lines to delete.

# 🗞️ cclio's gazette · the verdict day — the gate learns to read, a probe says no to the native way, and cclio gets a face on github

## shipped

- **the gate reads the verdict** — [BYT-92](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/BYT-92) done (#79 + #83): the ci reviewer ends every round with `verdict: clean | findings` in its sticky comment, the guard requires the line, and the decision lives in `review-gate.jq` with fixture cases and mutation checks (20 cases, 8 mutations, 12 real defects found by 4 reviewers across the two prs). measured live the same afternoon: findings → red and counted (#82 run 9), clean → green and counted (#82 run 11), unjudgeable → red and uncounted (runs 6–8), dima's approval → green (#83's own lane, on itself). a `renovate/*` lane publishes the check on green ci, actor renovate. the answer lane (5 of the 12 defects) is gone: past the cap the owner approves, 887 lines deleted.
- **the probe that said no** — dima: «i lost track of how pr merge protection is driven… overcomplicated». a research fork proposed the native design (require 1 approval + conversation resolution, the reviewer approves as the app); the coder probed it on a scratch pr: an app's APPROVED review is recorded and `reviewDecision` stays `REVIEW_REQUIRED`; one human approval flips it. so bot approvals cannot gate, the parser stays, and dima's verdict on the shape lives in [BYT-94](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/BYT-94) for the greptile-ci decision on 2026-09-16.
- **ci matrix** — [BYT-93](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/BYT-93) done (#82): a clean-clone filtered install per vercel app, read from each `vercel.json`; the renovate validator only on its file, postgres in its own job, chromium only when kit tests run. the round found a `needs:` edge that had made the required check skippable — the #72 trap, in a file that documents it.
- **evergreen** — jotai 3, npm-run-all2 9, the patch group (biome 2.5.12 unmasked a wrong optional-catch-all type in x-com-chat; the suggested fix would have crashed `/chat`), brew 13 upgrades (pnpm 12.4.1, node 26.8.2, vercel 59.16). finding: renovate prs could not merge since #75 — the gate had no path for them; `--admin` once, the renovate lane since.
- **cclio's face** — github app `x-cclio-cc` (4921020) on bytes + dotfiles, `pnpm github:agent-token x-cclio-cc`; attribution only, an app approval never counts. **init mini** (`/cclio:init mini`, cclio 0.3.40): healthcheck, inbox read-only with ✅ in place, no cst, no flowlog. **plugin eval** first run on plugin-x: `x:cmt` fires on «commit this» (Δ +1.00), two cases flaky at one run; the instrument for [DOT-243](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/DOT-243) only, results gitignored.
- **smaller**: [DOT-237](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/DOT-237) loses the raycast-ios research line (answered: a companion keyboard, no letter layout); [DOT-26](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/DOT-26) gains gifs (vhs + gifski installed, a gif is a screen recording, no base images), bot identities (vendor bots keep their names, vercel avatars are the one lever) and the notifications tune; `.node-version` = `24` in both repos, fnm stays (volta's readme says unmaintained, mise is the only live alternative); wispr flow + superwhisper in the Brewfile.

## tricks gained

- github closes a pr whose base branch is deleted — retarget stacked prs before merging the parent with `--delete-branch`
- an installed app's `author_association` is NONE: its reviews never satisfy a required-approval rule, in either direction
- the coder app cannot push or delete refs (no `contents: write`); api writes wear the app, pushes are dima's git
- runner jq is 1.7, the mac 1.8 — a jq program is proven when ci compiles it; `sd`/`sed` silently eat `${{ }}` in workflow files
- two negative turbo filters intersect; `turbo run --dry=json` lists packages with no such script
- a `gh api …/runs` waiter keys on `id > last seen`, never `status == completed`
- `performed_via_github_app` exists on issue comments only; `gh pr review` needs `--repo` without a checkout
- the `--case` flag of `claude plugin eval` takes one glob; a second is dropped

## state

- bytes `9870956e` + cclio's `.node-version` commit unpushed; dotfiles 4 commits + the flush unpushed; 0 open prs, coder `2ee2daa4` stopped after its retro
- next: wispr flow snippets with dima, the finance sub-item, the ralph first run on the guard fixtures, BYT-84, knip; 09-16: greptile-ci + BYT-94

⸻ upd 00:30 (2026-09-13)

## shipped (evening)

- **vercel zero, by deploy hooks** — [BYT-84](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/BYT-84) done (#84): vercel's git integration is off on all six apps; a `deploy.yml` job on push to `main` curls per-project deploy hooks for the apps turbo lists as affected, vercel still builds on its side. researched first at dima's ask: canceled deployments count toward the hobby cap (three vercel pages, 2026-08), `deploymentEnabled: false` is the only true zero, hooks survive it (probed on cv before any edit). the coder minted the six hooks and the secret itself (`vercel deploy-hooks create`, local cli auth, no token). first main push: job 36 s, cv prod Ready 15 s later. riders: `workflow_dispatch` per app, a job summary, no install in the job, a commit-msg guard for the ci-skip markers (proven by failing; dotfiles copy the same night). the why lives as an html comment in bytes root `CLAUDE.md`: a hobby-plan workaround, unnecessary on pro. follow-ups born in triage: [BYT-95](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/BYT-95) workflow_run lane, [BYT-96](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/BYT-96) preview lane by label (x-com-chat bumps build unbuilt until then, dima's call), [BYT-100](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/BYT-100) the review guard's jq argv overflow + the unguarded pr body.
- **ralph retired** — research: huntley's post is 2025-07, the plugin stale since 03-28 with 11 open stop-hook bugs, `/goal` is the native loop; the zenith study says a loop fights premature completion, not model iq, and earns tokens only when a task outlives one context. plugin uninstalled, [DOT-1](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/DOT-1) holds the `/goal` trial for the next long spec build; knip became [BYT-97](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/BYT-97), two granular steps, never a loop target.
- **the triggers, measured** — `claude plugin eval` ×4 on dima's real prompts: pm 12/12; notes 2/9 → 9/9 («flowlog», «notion» as literal words); cmt 1/12 → 12/12 once the description LEADS with «/cmt», «commit», «slay» and says «even mid-sentence or after another instruction». x 0.11.70. [DOT-243](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/DOT-243) carries the finding; the eval is the proof step for any description edit now (memory-nurture skills lane).
- **the burn** — the BYT-84 coder took ~85 % of a 5-hour window in 75 min: 638 turns at 250–460k context, 180M cache reads, 567k opus output; ci ping-pong with two adversaries and its own novel-length bodies. dima: no ceilings, no early auto-compact; trace the cases in `cclio/docs/ctx-burn-log.md`, dig in when it repeats.
- **smaller**: wispr flow answered research-backed (experimental tab = beta, press-enter is a spoken phrase, no claude desktop hook, notetaker replaces granola for english mac meetings, hooks read via remote mcp only, ukrainian dictation unclear); read-aloud: wispr + superwhisper have no tts, siri Voice 4 beat every premium voice in dima's ear, the Pronunciations table is the lever, sotto the free upgrade ([DOT-27](https://linear.app/x-com/issue/DOT-27)); finance: a mono usd virtual card topped up after salary, date sync only via cancel + resubscribe; monorepo project is bytes-only (DOT-245 → BYT-98, DOT-241 → BYT-99); dima's tools mil reordered DOT-26 → 39 → 147 → 237; his priorities 1–8 in the queue; PO doc-noise folded into DOT-244, the sys no-refetch gremlin into BYT-88; english practice stays on typed prompts only (wispr auto-fixes the rest).

## tricks gained (evening)

- github honours `[skip ci]` anywhere in a commit message, quoting included — no run created, silently; file contents are exempt. a `commit-msg` hook in both repos now
- no run at all reads like checks pending: ask «was a run created», never «is a check green»
- turbo `--affected` reads commits, not the working tree; refuses the literal `HEAD`; a root file with no dependants affects nothing — `globalDependencies` for `.npmrc` + `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
- a probe without a positive control is a coin flip (four attempts, three wrong, one backwards)
- linear: a project shared by two teams shows its tickets in both triages; one team per project
- a fork brief for a long run must say «wait in the foreground» — two forks ended on background watchers
- an echoed ⏳ block is an accept; an ask leaves the fence the turn it is verdicted

## state (evening)

- dotfiles `1c13abf` + the halt commit, bytes `946f1669`, both on origin; no coder (BYT-84's stopped after its retro), no worktrees, 0 open prs
- tomorrow: the created-count read (zero canceled?), then dima's priority 1: BYT-95 → BYT-96 → BYT-100; 09-16 greptile-ci + BYT-94; DOT-26 waits on his word
