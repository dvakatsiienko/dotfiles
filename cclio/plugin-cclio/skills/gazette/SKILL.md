# /cclio:gazette — cclio's gazette 🗞️ the tweet and the wire

**cclio's gazette** — cclio writes it, cclio owns it, the masthead says so. the durable event
history plus its outward release. the halt calls this BEFORE the CST, so the
handoff carries only what the gazette did not already say.

**what it is (dima, 2026-09-03): the memory of what meaningful stuff we did, not a mirror of
the tracker.** anything that changed something belongs — a ticketed close and a bare todo fixed
in place carry equal weight; an immediate ask done without a ticket is exactly the kind of fact
only the gazette keeps. meaningful only — a minor move stays out, however fresh. on point only: the fact and its effect, no talk, no fluff. a linear body
already describes the ticket; the post says what happened.

## phase 1 — the tweet (always, no gate)

write the day's post: `cclio/gazette/YYYY-MM-DD-<short-slug>.md`.

- **one file per day.** a second halt the same day APPENDS under a `⸻ upd hh:mm` rule — never a
  second file. slug is minted at first write and stays.
- **source from evidence, not memory of your own turns**: `git log --since=<today>` across
  touched repos, the day's linear activity, the session context last — coders and cw leave
  traces cclio's thread never saw.
- frontmatter: `date` · `slug` · `tickets: [DOT-N, …]` · `posted: {health: no}`
- header line: `# 🗞️ cclio's gazette · <slug title>` — the masthead leads every post
- skeleton, soft cap ~25 lines:
  - **shipped** — what landed, every fact linear-linked
  - **tricks gained** — fleet-useful finds, gotchas, new capabilities
  - **state** — what is open, where it parked
- fleet voice. only facts that changed something; a fact links its ticket, never restates the
  body; dates absolute, never «today».
- dedup: read the previous post before writing.

## phase 2 — the wire (gated)

the release — derived from the tweet, pushed outward.

- **gate:** bare halt → ask «🗞️ the wire? y/n» and **block until a literal answer**; stop lane →
  auto-yes, run without asking.
- **health update** for each project the tweet touched — **no title line**: pulse already shows the
  date and the author, the body starts at the first paragraph (dima, 2026-09-02) — ⚠️ full markdown
  links (health updates do not auto-link ids). **the house style — settled by the 4-round live test with dima,
  2026-08-27, screenshots verified in linear:**
  - **hybrid voice**: fleet structure carries the scanning (emoji line-prefix per paragraph,
    bold verdict openers), the sentences underneath stay human — `x:writing-for-humans` flow,
    no id-stuffing, no arrow chains, rhythm varies
  - **paragraphs 2–3 rendered lines each**, one thought per paragraph — linear renders wide;
    a paragraph that wants two tickets is two paragraphs
  - **ticket badges at sentence edges**: linear renders an id link as a fat badge with the full
    title, so a badge goes at a line end after a colon — the sentence carries the meaning, the
    badge is the door. **one badge per paragraph, ~3 per update**, never inside parentheses
  - **the inverse of a commit message**: not what changed — **what got easier for dima**, each
    paragraph a gain written for him, not for an agent
- **pulse is the feed** — dima enabled linear's pulse (2026-08-30), so the reply names WHICH
  projects got a post, one line total; no per-post links, no gists.
- flip the `posted:` marks after each fanout — a re-run with marks already yes is a no-op, so
  the wire fires at most once per day's content.

## phase 2.5 — the initiative update (gated: a mil completed this session)

the linear initiative «roadmap» carries the plan-level feed, one post per **milestone end**,
never daily (dima, 2026-09-03: «gazette - daily, initiative - per mil (end)»). the gate is
literal: a milestone reached done/total this session, or a roadmap step closed. nothing → skip
silently. when it fires: three sentences — what became true, what starts, what it unblocks —
through `initiativeUpdateCreate` (same shape as the project update, `health` included), full
markdown links for ids. a step transition also rewrites the initiative body's nine-line list and
moves the attached projects to the new step (`memory/dima-roadmap.md`, using it).

## completion criterion

the day's file holds today's facts with correct `posted:` marks, and the reply names what went
out on the wire (or that it was declined).

📌 the first two runs are the shakedown — this file was written before run #1 (rule-break
approved 2026-08-26); fix what reality disagrees with the same session it disagrees.

## 👁️ ingest side (for reference)

every post ends with a `## trail` section: three bullets, `shipped:` / `open:` / `state:`, one line each — the only part of the post that stays resident. after writing the post, run `cclio/.claude/hooks/gazette-trail.sh` (from the dotfiles root) — it regenerates `gazette/_trail.md`, which the memory barrel imports into every cclio boot. the full posts sit in `gazette/`; a multi-day arc may warrant reading one — the boot judges.
