description: Load when Dima asks to be walked through something, a ticket carries the walkthrough label, or teaching-by-showing beats a doc.

# /walkthrough — teach by showing, on his machine

the mode dima wants: he runs one command, looks at HIS data, gets ONE insight, says «next».
born from the DOT-157/DOT-158 tours; retro data in `docs/research/walkthrough-mode.md`.

## the flow

1. **plan first.** on the opening turn, think through the whole tour and print the map — one line
   per stop, numbered. **~5 stops is the starter shape**, not a cap: a small topic takes 3, a big
   one may take 7+. fewer and bigger beats many and thin.
2. **one stop per turn.** he replies, asks questions, digresses — answer in full, then re-anchor.
   a digression never consumes a stop.
3. **«next» advances.** every turn ends with the hook line (below); he types «next» (or anything
   meaning it) to move on. steering words («deeper», «skip», «back») reshape the tour — say when
   the map changed.
4. **declare the end.** restate the map at the last stop and say the tour is over — the end is
   invisible from inside. offer the digressions worth a follow-up.

## the hook line — every turn, last line

    ➡️ next: <one line naming the next stop> · (2/5)

- the counter tracks **stops completed / total**, updated every turn, including after map reshapes
- on the final stop it becomes `✅ tour done (5/5)` plus what to explore next

## step shape — four beats, this order, every time

1. **anchor command** — one short read-only command HE runs; output fits a screen
2. **observation** — name what he is looking at, in his output's own words
3. **insight** — exactly one per step; the part the output cannot tell him. teach it properly:
   how it works, the why behind the shape, tips and tricks that make him faster
4. **hook line** — as above, then STOP

the anchor comes BEFORE the explanation. explain-then-run turns the command into homework.

## live-over-lecture — the rule that carries it

- every claim demonstrated on HIS machine; a generic fact persuades nobody.
- **spend a command on his wrong guess** — `touch /bin/.t → Operation not permitted` taught the
  sealed volume in one line; a flat «no» teaches nothing.
- teach through the session's own near-misses; a story with a number beats a rule stated flat.
- mid-to-high overview pace; deep only where a real hazard lives.
- post-checks check **state, not presence** — a grep can say «still registered» while the truth
  is «waiting to uninstall on reboot».
- resuming after unrelated work = explicit re-anchor step first.

## after

- write the tour down: a doc in `docs/research/` (subject-first name) so the teaching survives the
  session. the tour teaches; the doc endures.
- if tickets rode along, their bodies get the outcomes — chat is not storage.

## surface notes

- ccli: run anchors via Bash yourself only to verify; the point is HE runs them.
- `cw` / desktop: relay steps via messages, or offer switching to the executing session.
